# MAT's Bot
***A multi-purpose Discord Bot created by NinjaSnail1080#8581***

__Default prefixes__: `!mat`, `mat.`, or `mat/`

Note: The prefix `!mat` must have a space between it and the command. The other two don't require this space.

---

The prefix can be changed for your server with the `prefix` command.

## Self-Hosting
I would prefer if you didn't self-host my bot. Instead, you can just invite it to your own server [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=459559711210078209&scope=bot&permissions=2146958591). However, if you really want to self-host it, the installation steps are as follows:

1. **Get Python 3.6 or higher**

This is required to actually run the bot

2. **Clone this repository**

3. **Set up a virtual environment**

Do `python3 -m venv <path to repository>`

4. **Once in the venv, install dependencies**

Run `python3 -m pip install -U -r REQUIREMENTS.txt`

5. **Create a database in PostGreSQL**

You will need version 9.5 or higher

6. **Setup configuration**

Create a file in the root directory called `config.py` and add the variables required to run the bot. There's a list of them in `config_info.txt`.
